## Simulation and Analysis Demo

This repository contains MATLAB scripts that can be used as templates for:
1) simulation of post-synaptic currents rising from detection of co-packaging and independent release of glutamate and GABA neurotransmitters
2) analysis of simulated dataset
3) analysis of electrophysiology experimental dataset. 

Please see the publication for detailed description of analysis workflow (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.23.436594v1)

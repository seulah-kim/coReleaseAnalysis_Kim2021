## Simulation and analysis demo for glutamate/GABA co-release dataset in Kim et al. 2021

This repository contains MATLAB scripts that can be used as templates for 1) simulation of co-packaging and independent release of glutamate and GABA neurotransmitters, 2) analysis of simulated dataset, and 3) analysis of electrophysiology dataset. 

Please see the publication for detailed description of analysis workflow (url for the paper)
